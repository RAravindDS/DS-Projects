# Stroke_Predictions

## Aim:
   Our ulitmate aim to predict the Stroke. 
   
   
* Here I used the dataset "healtcare.csv". I have uploaded with the file. 
* we need to find the stroke of the person by using feature names like age, bmi and many things.
* In the data set we have categorical as well as, numerical data also.

## Here I have Done: 
### i) Data Analysis
### ii) Feature Engineering
### iii) Feature Selection
### iv) Model Building
### v) Model Delpoyment( local server using swagger ). 


## Data Analysis: 
* No correlated features in the dataset. 
* Only few missing values in the bmi. 
* Our data is completly imbalanced dataset. 
* All are positvely correlated variables with each others. 
* All the insights are gatherd form seaborn and plotly. 

## Feature Engineering: 
* Done categorical and numerical encoding.
* Done Imbalanced to balanced data. 
* Done Scaling. 
* Done satistical analysis. 

## Feature Selection: 
* Used chi2 test for feature selection.

## Model Building:
* Used variety of algos like logistic, tree, randomforest, xgb, ann. 
* Done variety of hyperparameter optimizations. 
* At last ANN only performed well in all. 

## Deployment: 
* Used swagger as a web application, build simple looking UI and It worked fine.
